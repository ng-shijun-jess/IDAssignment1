                <p>
                    <br/>In this reflection,I'll be writing about the GG? (Good Game?) talk that I have attended. This blog post will cover what the talk is about, the different ways of coercive monetization and the consequences to game addiction.  

                    <br/><br/>GG? (Good Game?) is an event hosted by Eventbrite on Thursday 20th May 2021 16:00 (+08) that teaches youth the psychology behind making a game for players to be addicted to and how game companies uses this addiction to earn monetary profits through Coercive Monetization. The talk included interactive feedback in the beginning of the talk where participants are to answer what games they play and whether they have spent money on games before. Through the feedback, we were able to see that many of the participants love to play First-Person Shooting games (eg. Call Of Duty) and MMO/MOBA (eg. League of Legends) while others plays social games (eg. Among Us) and simulation (eg. Sims) . The remaining few would usually play puzzle games (eg. Candy Crush).
                    
                    <br/><br/>Then, the host introduce us to the three ways that game companies used to trick players into being hooked to the game: 
                    <ol>
                        <li>Conditioning</li>
                        <li>Sunk cost</li>
                        <li>Social pressure</li>
                    </ol>
                    <br/>For the first maneuver, Conditioning mean to reward players by playing the game or giving them a winning start. One example would be the daily rewards. 
                    <br/><br/>Sunk cost means making players to pay in order to help keep game-in progress for them or make in-app purchases to progress in the game (eg. secret endings). 
                    
                    <br/><br/>Finally, there is social pressure, which sourced from your friends as they send you friend requests to join the friend circle. Sometimes they pressure you to download or play frequently in real life. Some games rewards players for successfully inviting  a new player to the game. 
                    
                    <br/><br/>Analyzing this, two of the three methods include rewarding the players for an action the player does.
                     
                    
                    <br/><br/>So what is the next step? Coercive Monetization.
                    
                    <br/><br/>The host for the talk then told us the three methods of Coercive Monetization are:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Premium currencies</li>
                        <li>Sense of emergency</li>
                        <li>Randomized rewards</li>
                    </ol>
                    
                    <br/>Premium currencies is self-explanatory, which means the fictional currencies that the game   uses for 'purchasing'. However, those currencies are hard to get, and the easiest way to obtain these premium currencies is through in-app purchases and spending real money so that the game help 'convert' real money to the game premium currency. 


                    <br/><br/>For the second method, sense of emergency usually refers to the limited offer or discounts for  certain item that players can purchase with the game currencies. However, for many occasions, currencies are hard to come buy or there is several purchases required that there is not enough game currency to purchase this discounted item. Game companies will them then make use of this opportunity to make user purchase the game currency with real money. 
                    
                    <br/><br/>The third method is randomized rewards, where players are given a chance to win a rare reward. This can be compare with the technique called 'Gacha' where Gacha is a monetization technique used in many successful Japanese free-to-play games.
                    
                    <br/><br/>The event host then warned us that playing too much is an addiction.
                    
                    <br/><br/>
                    This can result in:
                    <br/>-Guilty feelings
                    <br/>-Fatigue
                    <br/>-Insomnia
                    <br/>-Irritability 
                    <br/>-Neglection of hobbies, friends, family and work
                    <br/>-Drops in grades. 
                    
                    <br/><br/>And that was the end of the talk.
                    
                    <br/><br/>After the talk, I saw games in a whole new perspective and was able to identify the Coercive Monetization methods and methods on getting players hooked to games. 
                    
                    <br/><br/>As someone who has the ambition to be a game artist/designer in the future, this talk has been enlightening. I concluded that being a game designer or part of the game company, it is important to not only think about how to make the story or game mechanics to be appealing and fun for players, but to also think in the business side and take advantages of the opportunity to make money.
