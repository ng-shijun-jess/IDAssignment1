                    - Project [Unknown] :
                    <br/> As one of the new EXCO member of Ngee Ann polytechnic's Special Interest Group DOTSIG, we have some form of responsibility and authority. Previous EXCO memberss have held sessions as such:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Introducing drawing method as a topic through Powerpoint slides</li>
                        <li>Break</li>
                        <li>Have everyone to draw usinng the drawing method</li>
                        <li>Submit Attendence</li>
                        <li>Repeat</li>
                    </ul>
                    Although useful, a few of us already know the theory of these drawing method,the time taken to look through the methods eats up the time remaining for practice. 
                    That is why there is some minor changes to how the next batch of EXCO members will run the sessions.
                    <br/><br/>For the upcoming few sessions, the EXCO members will provide a theme for the members to draw and within the session timing. 
                    We encourage every member to draw for not only will it be part of a world building, but might also be part of a Dungeons and Dragon campaign.
                    DOTSIG is about allowing members to take this time to be creative through art medias. We wish for sessions to be more engaging do that more members are willing to join. 
                    DOTSIG is not known for the large number of members participating the session as another Co-Curriculum Activity called COMINK does the same thing as DOTSIG. And being memebrs of both,
                    I can understand why COMINK is more popular than DOTSIG.

                    <br/><br/>Some ideas the EXCO members have for DOTSIG:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Project to create a website together (Following what AMPHIBISTUDIO is doing)</li>
                        <li>Project for World-Building and increasing story line (Currently in action)</li>
                        <li>Continuing what the the seniors have done</li>
                    </ul>
                    So far we have hosted the first session with the theme: Steampunk
                    <br/><br/>
